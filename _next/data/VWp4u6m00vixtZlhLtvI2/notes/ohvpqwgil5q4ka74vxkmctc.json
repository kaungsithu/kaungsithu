But let me simplify it. Imagine a kitchen 🍳. If data analysts are the chefs creating delicious dishes (insights), data engineers are the prep cooks ensuring ingredients (raw data) are cleaned, chopped, and ready to use. Without them, the kitchen (business analytics) would be in chaos! </p>\n<p>In this talk, I shared my journey transitioning into data engineering, explored key responsibilities, and gave a peek into AWS data solutions that make our jobs easier.  </p>\n<!-- ## 👤 A Little About Me  \n\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTcernNZxhSn4Rj9bysdt25nfd6-PCaEdk-SnMP2gnLIr4B-JK7fz2Z8TLFblfaTaMWeLpLH37TOihe/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000&rm=minimal\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\nHi, I’m Kaung SiThu, a Lead Data Engineer with a deep love for tech and a never-ending curiosity for knowledge.
