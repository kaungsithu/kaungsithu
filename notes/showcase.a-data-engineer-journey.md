## 🪧 Introduction  

When people ask, “What is data engineering?” they often expect a complicated, jargon-heavy explanation. But let me simplify it. Imagine a kitchen 🍳. If data analysts are the chefs creating delicious dishes (insights), data engineers are the prep cooks ensuring ingredients (raw data) are cleaned, chopped, and ready to use. Without them, the kitchen (business analytics) would be in chaos! 

In this talk, I shared my journey transitioning into data engineering, explored key responsibilities, and gave a peek into AWS data solutions that make our jobs easier.  


<!-- ## 👤 A Little About Me

Hi, I’m Kaung SiThu, a Lead Data Engineer with a deep love for tech and a never-ending curiosity for knowledge. My path to data engineering wasn’t straightforward—I started in manufacturing, working as a system engineer. But life had different plans, and curiosity led me into the world of data. 

💡 Fun fact: My procrastination catalysts? Overanalyzing and getting lost in rabbit holes of knowledge. 😆   -->

At its core, **data engineering is all about collecting, transforming, and preparing data** so it can be easily used by businesses to make better decisions. Rather than just throwing out definitions, I like to explain it through something most of us are already familiar with — cooking! 🍽️

### 🍳 The Kitchen Vs The Business Analytics

- **Data Engineers = Prep Cooks** 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳  
  - They gather, clean, and organize the ingredients (raw data).  
- **Data Analysts = Chefs** 🔪  
  - They take these ingredients and turn them into a final dish (insights and reports).  
- **Data Platform = The Kitchen** 🏠  
  - The space where all of this magic happens.  

_**A well-functioning kitchen means faster, better, and more scalable decision-making!**_ 📊  


## 🔄 The Career Shift to Data Engineering

<br/>

<br/><br/>

Transitioning from manufacturing system engineering to data engineering was not an overnight decision. It took **curiosity, effort, and a willingness to learn**. Many professionals hesitate to make such a switch, hesitating or doubting their capabilities of the necessary skills. But here’s what I learned:

### 🎯 Key Lessons:
1. **Your Past Skills Are Transferable** ➝ My system engineering background gave me an analytical mindset that proved invaluable in data engineering.  
2. **Continuous Learning is Essential** 📚 ➝ I embraced reading and watching online articles, documentations, courses, and mentors to bridge knowledge gaps.  
3. **Overcoming Impostor Syndrome** 😨 ➝ Doubts creep in, but every challenge is a stepping stone.


## 🏆 Essential Traits of a Data Engineer

<br/>

<br/><br/>

To thrive in this data field -- especially data engineering, here are some **key skills and mindsets**:

✅ **Attention to Detail** – Double-checking work, breaking down complex problems.  
✅ **Curiosity** – Asking ‘why?’ and ‘how?’ about data.  
✅ **Continuous Learning** – Staying up to date with trends and tools.


## ☁️ AWS Experiences – Why Cloud?

<br/>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSPYlFSSRMw1JUnGpVc6YJXH9qrZJh6SKlP0S7ATQeQWvEVRfUs8noE1LSuwkI_aQht8knChTmJUj36/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000&rm=minimal" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
<br/><br/>

The cloud is not just a buzzword—it’s a game-changer. Instead of maintaining expensive on-prem servers, companies can scale up or down as needed. AWS dominates the market, and for a good reason:

🔹 **Cost efficiency** – Pay for what you use.  
🔹 **Scalability** – Grow as your data grows.  
🔹 **Community Support** – Large user base = more resources & solutions.  


## 🚀 Getting Started with AWS Analytics Solutions


Our team took on AWS, learning as we built our data platform. It was a mix of excitement and challenges, but AWS’s strong support helped us get up to speed quickly. 

💡 One surprising experience? AWS support responded to my late-night query within minutes and solved an issue that had blocked me for the whole day! 🤯  

## 🔥 The Data Kitchen
